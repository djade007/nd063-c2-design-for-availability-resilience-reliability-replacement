1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage:
This is automated as Amazon RDS automatically switches to a standby replica in another Availability Zone.
Which may take 60 â€“ 120 seconds.

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage:
The RTO will be the time needed to promote the RDS Read Replica to a standalone primary instance.
Since this is manual, it can take a minimum of 3 minutes and another 3 minutes to update the endpoints.

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
Since there is a separate synchronous copy of the databae instance in a separate AZ.
There shouldn't be any data loss.

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage:
There shouldn't also be any data loss since there is an active read replica in another region.
